Hi,

Thanks for your time.

Time to complete: a little under 3 hours

I found the instructions to be clear and i didn't find any ambiguity except I was confused at the number of body parts we should have drawn for the man. 
We were told to allow the user to guess as many times until they get the correct answer, but i didn't find this very effective. 
As a result I imlemented a "YOU WON" if you guessed the correct word before the entire man was drawn and a "YOU LOST" if the user guessed the word after the man was already drawn.

I attached my outline as a PDF.

Thank you again for your time!
All the best.
